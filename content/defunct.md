The following domains were previously allocated, but are now defunct:

* kulupu.pona.la — forum by soweli Masi. Closed [due to moderation concerns](https://web.archive.org/web/20231114030939/https://kulupu.pona.la/d/155-notice-of-the-shutdown-of-kulupu-lipu-pona-until-further-notice), but [is available as an archive](https://archive.org/details/kulupu.pona.la).
* linku.pona.la — use [linku.la](https://linku.la) instead
* lipu.pona.la — previously a writefreely instance by jan Kita. Closed due to spam abuse. Now handed over to a [Toki Pona library](https://lipu.pona.la), including an archive of the freewritely instance.
* ma.pona.la — previously redirected to the Discord server [ma pona pi toki pona](https://discord.gg/6zkugJFU4x). Now used for a [map of Toki Pona speakers](https://ma.pona.la).
* toki.pona.la — see kulupu.pona.la (previously used subdomain before choosing kulupu.pona.la)
* toktok.pona.la — purpose unclear
