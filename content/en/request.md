## addition requests

If you understand what dns is, you can request dns entries at [lawa@pona.la](mailto:lawa@pona.la) right away. Otherwise, let me explain how you can have your own site here. I will explain how to get things done with <a href="https://github.com">github</a>, so you will have to create an accout there.

1. Before you do anything, you can send me an email to reserve a subdomain (the part of `.pona.la` link before the first dot) until you are done with your page
2. Create a repository that contains your website. We have a very useful template <a href="https://github.com/pona-la/lipu-sin">here</a> that can get you started on this task, read the README.md carefully.
3. 
  * If you want to avoid having to deal with setting up pages, just go to the repository's settings, scroll down to Transfer Ownership and write `pona-la`
  * If you want the repository to stay on your account or in organization, go to the repository's settings's pages tab, enable pages on the right branch, and write the `.pona.la` link you reserved
4. If you contacted me first, I will set everything up right away, otherwise, please contact me at [lawa@pona.la](mailto:lawa@pona.la), so I know how to set things up. To speed things up, include the repo link, it makes things easier.

If you have any questions about the process, or encountered a problem, shoot me an email at [lawa@pona.la](mailto:lawa@pona.la), I will do my best to answer you.
